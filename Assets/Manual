    World Generation
    text
    When generating the world there are a series of different stats that can be adjusted.
    World size is the most important and constrains the other adjustable stats. The world size
    determines the total possible number of tree and lakes that can appear in your world.
    Terrian features however can be adjusted within a range determined by the size of your world
    but cannot be set to high as to avoid issues with generation.
